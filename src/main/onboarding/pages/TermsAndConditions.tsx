              primary care practice. It is not a remote full-service medical
              practice. Your use of the Remote Healthcare Services offered
              through the Platform and the Platform technology (collectively the
              “Services”) is voluntary. You may seek in-person treatment at any
              time. The Platform is a Remote Healthcare Service, which does not
              allow for an in-person physical examination by the treating
              Provider. The absence of an in-person physical examination may
              affect the Provider’s ability to diagnose any potential condition,
              disease, or injury and may not reveal potentially serious medical
              conditions. The diagnosis you receive may be limited. The Services
              are not intended in all cases to replace a full medical
              evaluation, or an in-person visit with a healthcare provider. Your
              Provider may not be able to diagnose or treat you if you require
              an in-person physical exam, a test that requires a follow-up
              visit, or if you present with potential symptoms or conditions
              that we do not treat remotely based on our medical policies and
              Provider judgment. Providers may be limited by applicable law,
              regulations, policies, and standards in prescribing certain
              medications to you without first conducting an in-person physical
              examination. Providers do not prescribe controlled substances,
              such as those containing opioids. Providers reserve the right to
              deny care for actual or potential misuse of the Service. The
              health information you provide through the Platform, and your
              pre-existing Cosmicforge medical record, may be the only source of
              information used by Providers during your evaluation and treatment
              through the Platform. Providers may not have access to any other
              information held by your non-Cosmicforge medical providers (e.g.,
              allergies, drug reactions, etc.). Care that you receive is based
              on your symptoms and other information you provide or upload to
              the Platform or share with your Provider(s) and care team.
              Information you provide using the Platform must be true, accurate,
              and complete, and may serve as the basis of any diagnosis and
              treatment by your Provider. If you provide false, misleading, or
              incomplete information to a Provider, it may have a negative
              effect on your treatment and your health. If you refuse to provide
              requested information, you may not be considered to be under the
              care of the Provider and the Provider may refuse to treat you (or
              continue to treat you, as applicable). A variety of alternative
              methods of medical care may be available to you, including an
              in-person visit. You may stop using the Services and choose one or
              more of these alternative modes of care at any time. Use of the
              Services may involve asynchronous communications, such as
              completing forms and messaging your care team, as well as direct
              virtual, synchronous, communications and the electronic
              transmission of medical information and other data between you and
              the Provider(s). As part of the Remote Healthcare Services, you
              may not be able to select a specific Provider. Due to emergencies,
              scheduling, and other circumstances, there may be times that the
              Services are unavailable. Emergencies The Platform should not be
              utilized in a medical emergency. If this is a medical emergency,
              visit an emergency room. If you are experiencing emotional
              distress or a mental health crisis, please contact the National
              Suicide Prevention Hotline. Nature of Electronic Services The
              electronic nature of the Services means that there is a greater
              risk to the privacy of your electronic health information relative
              to receiving in-person care. For information about the privacy and
              security practices as well as our information sharing practices,
              please read our Privacy policy. The information transmitted may
              not be sufficient (e.g. poor resolution of images) to allow for
              appropriate medical or healthcare decision making by the Provider.
              In addition, technical failures could lead to delays in evaluation
              or to information lost due to such technical failures. If you are
              experiencing technical difficulties through the Platform, you may
              email us (check our contact information) In connection with the
              Service: • Data, chat text, audio, video, and/or digital photos
              may be recorded; • Details of your medical information may be
              discussed with you and the Providers via the Service using
              electronic technology, including chat, audio, video, and/or
              graphics technology; • Virtual examination of you may take place;
              and • Medical personnel and non-medical technical personnel may
              join the visit, virtually, to aid in delivery of medical care to
              you, or for the purpose of improving the Service. All
              communications in either electronic or paper format from us to you
              will be considered to be in writing. Print or download a copy of

              DATA BREACH NOTIFICATION POLICY; In line with Nigeria Data
              Protection Act 2023 (the NDPA) which has defined Personal data
              breach as “a breach of security of a data controller or data
              processor leading to or likely to lead to the accidental or
              unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure
              of, or access to, personal data transmitted, stored, or otherwise
              processed.” Example of these breach includes but no limited to ,
              Confidentiality breach, integrity breach (alteration of personal
              data), availability breach (accidental destruction, deletion of
              personal data by unauthorized parties) The following steps shall
              be taking in the event of a Breach; 1. Users are allowed to use
              the online notification form, to notify Cosmicforge of a breach 2.
              Identification of the type of breach, its locations and recipients
              by data processor management. These includes personal data stored
              in physical or virtual storage facilities or any other form of
              storage. 3. Activation of the incident response team once a
              security incident has occurred, to implement the incident response
              plan led by an assigned incident manager. 4. investigate the data
              breach to ensure that the investigative evidence is appropriately
              handled and preserved. 5. Collect and review any breach response
              documentation and analyze reports. 6. Report to the Data
              controller 7. communicate the personal data breach to the data
              subject in plain and clear language, including advice about
              measures the data subject could take to mitigate effectively the
              possible adverse effects of the data breach and if a direct
              communication to the data subject would involve disproportionate
              effort or expense, or is otherwise not feasible, the data
              controller may instead make a public communication in one or more
              widely used media sources such that the data subject is likely to
              be informed.The NDPC may make a public communication about a
              personal data breach notified to it by the data controller if
              dissatisfied with the data controller’s notice to data subjects.
              Data Breach Notification Content; The content or style of
              reporting a breach notice must contain (a) the name and contact
              details of a point of contact of the data controller, where more
              information can be obtained; (b) a description of the likely
              consequences of the personal data breach; and (c) a description of
              the measures taken or proposed to be taken to address the personal
              data breach, including, where appropriate, measures to mitigate
              its possible adverse effects. It is key that the contact point
              should be easily accessible, and allow for a quick response from
              the data controller or its agents to inquiries by affected data
              subjects, especially as every “minute” is key for personal data
              breach remediation.
